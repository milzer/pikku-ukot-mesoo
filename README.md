# Pikku-ukot mesoo

**Pikku-ukot mesoo** is a shooter game, inspired by classics like Liero and Molez, developed between 1999 and 2001.

## Important Notice

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, the game is currently unbuildable due to its reliance on a proprietary and now obsolete game engine.

## Future Plans

I'm considering the possibility of revitalizing the game by porting it to a more contemporary and accessible platform, such as SFML. However, finding time and motivation for such a project is quite challenging üç∫

## Contributing

Your interest and contributions to the game are warmly welcomed. Whether it's through forking the project to explore new possibilities, or just sharing ideas for its future, every bit of support counts.
